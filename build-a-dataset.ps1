#Vertical pipe would be far better so we can see end results in little time...
#Threading API requests a good idea...

#Scenario should include at bare minimum location and appearance of characters.

#Version 2 list
#Most of this stuff can be figured out in the ps1 file that uses these tools...
#1. Don't Overwrite ~~files~~ 
#2. Require output_json (or more specifically use std_out)
#3. implement std_in std_out (as json) consider only making askIt write to file
#4. let splitIt append to the end of a key
#5. revert to original names
#6. promptIt just prompts based on promptTemplate... askIt just asks based on apiTemplate... use verbose if you want to see the actual calls
#7. promptIt creates prompt OR prompt array
#8. forget vertical prompts... not good start small / deconstruct as needed
#9. Have promptIt append if response is present.

## Phase I Getting Pairs of Character Descriptions
python scripts/promptIt.py  --json "books" --output_key "prompt"    --batch_size 50 `
    --next_prompt   "List the top {batch_size} most prolific books in the entire public domain. Each entry in your response will be directly parsed into a JSON dataset so please ONLY provide the name of the **book** without further elaboration or commentary."`

## Phase IV Generating Scenarios for each character pair based on the assigned mood

first_prompt=$(cat <<'EOF'
Hey! I have a great idea for a creative writing exercise and I need your help. I've matched together pairs of characters from all kinds of literature in the public domain and I'd like you to think up an imaginative scenario prompt for how they might interact with eachother!
Some of these character pairs might be pretty weird because they were mixed together at random but that's part of the fun! Don't be afraid to push the narative a little let's say PG-13 at max but the writing exercise is for adults not kids.
Can I also request that the scenario is character centric? So like the location and conflict or objective should be built to facilitate an interesting dialogue of some sort that showcases the unique dynamic between them. 

The two characters for the scenario are **{character_name1}** from {book1} and **{character_name2}** from {book2}.
I want you to really think about who these chararacters are and how they'd interact.

Who is **{character_name1}**? Who is **{character_name2}**? What would they likely think of each other? How are they different or the same?
What would be an ideal **{scenario_mood}** setting and environment to contrast and explore the dynamic these characters might have through dialogue?
What might {character_name1} want from {character_name2}? Did {character_name2} force {character_name1} to be here or did they happen to just cross paths?
A good scenario prompt focuses on the dynamics between the characters. 

When thinking of the scenario, keep in mind that the subsequent role-play dialogue will strictly involve these two characters. This means they will need to "narrate" the surrounding events within their own dialogue or actions. So the scenario should allow them to express the context of the scene through their perspective.
*Note: Your response is going to be added to a dataset where the above character descriptions will already be provided so please ONLY provide the scenario prompt you came up with.*

## Part V Generating Roleplay Conversations
first_prompt=$(cat <<'EOF'
Generate a 2,000 token interaction between the following characters in asterisk roleplay format. Use asterisks to vividly describe character actions/sensations and do not wrap spoken word with double quotes. Your response will be used in a dataset to train a large language model about long form character roleplay.

## {character_name1} ({book1}):
{character_description1}

## {character_name2} ({book2}):
{character_description2}

## Scenario:
{scenario}

*Note: It's critical that the actions and dialogue match the characters as they are depicted in their descriptions. Every line in your response should alternate between "{character_name1}:" and "{character_name2}:"*

Below is the first part of a character roleplay dialogue paired with two characters, a scenario, and an important note on roleplay guidelines. Progress the scene by writing part II of the dialogue using asterisk roleplay format. Each line in your response must be from the perspective of one of the characters (see format guidelines).

## Scenario:

## Roleplay Dialogue (Part I):

## Roleplay Guidelines
Really think about who these characters are. Who is {character_name1}? Who is {character_name2}? What would {character_name1} think of {character_name2}? How would {character_name2} think of {character_name1}? Compare and contrast {character_name1} to {character_name2} and make sure {character_name1} acts and speaks like {character_name1} and {character_name2} acts and speaks like {character_name2}.
1. DO be creative and immersive.
2. DO use asterisks (*) to vividly describe character actions, thoughts, and sensations from the first-person perspective of one of the two characters.
3. DO start each message with a character's name. There should be no third-party narration or observations. The scene should unfold exclusively from the characters' viewpoints.
4. DO NOT include dialogue or actions from any characters outside "{character_name1}" and "{character_name2}".
5. DO NOT repeat the same dialogue due to uncertainty about how to progress the scene. Each line should move the narrative forward or add depth to the characters.
6. DO ensure that each line of dialogue clearly advances the scene. The characters' actions or decisions should drive the plot forward.
7. DO highlight the individuality of the characters. They should maintain distinct thoughts, plans, and actions, whether they are allies or adversaries. Actions and dialogue should reflect the character's individual perspectives and motivations.
